## My process

First I had made this page using flex and box, but after having done it and I got a little confused in the responsiveness, having seen that the code was too long. I noticed that the entire site could use the CSS grid layout.

So, after that I deleted all the positioning scripts and redid them using the Grid Layout, and it worked.
I confess that I did not think I was capable of such a feat. I'm proud of my result.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

Now I'm going to try to make some more complex and bigger pages. As soon as I finish them, I'll go after mastering the use of ReactJS and the API's.
